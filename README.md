**This mod is an update/rewrite of Mioudew's *Mermaid Replaces Mariner* mod (found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2604)).** The original mod has several issues (overwriting newer game content, overriding language selection, some minor grammatical problems), so I ripped it apart and created a proper Content Patcher mod from the pieces. (There is an unofficial Content Patcher update for the original, but it exhibits all of the same problematic behaviours as the XNB version.)

This is my first venture into the world of modding Stardew Valley, so suggestions and critiques are encouraged.

*Known issues:*
* The mermaids only show up in spring, summer, and fall. The Old Mariner is in his usual place if you cause it to rain during the winter. I would like to eventually create a fourth, special mermaid to fill that gap.i
* The mod will only activate if you have your language set to English. I am (sadly) monolingual, so I am unable to provide translations of sufficient quality.
* The three mermaids have essentially the same dialogue. I intend to give them some individual character at some point.

**Contributions are very welcome** (especially translations and graphics)!
